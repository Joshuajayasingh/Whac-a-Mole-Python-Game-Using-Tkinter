## Setup

1. **Download Required Assets**

This game needs the following assets:

* `whacs.jpg` â€” Background image
* `moles.png` â€” Mole image
* `theme.wav` â€” Background music
* `hit.wav` â€” Sound on hitting mole
* `lost.wav` â€” Sound on losing the game

You can download all required files from this link:
ðŸ”— [Download Game Assets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14k5J8jKl5MqXV1a7fVO2uFpHjWntE4Tm?usp=sharing)

2. **Place Files**

## How to Run

```bash
python whac-a-mole.py
```

---

## Game Rules

* The game has infinite levels. Each level has 10 mole appearances.
* You must hit all 10 moles to proceed to the next level.
* Missing even 1 mole ends the game.
* The mole speed increases with each level.
* Your score and name are saved in a persistent leaderboard.

---

## Leaderboard Storage

Scores are stored locally in `leaderboard.bin` using Python's `pickle`. It records:

* High score per player
* Cumulative score across all sessions

---

## Notes

* If image or sound files are missing, an error popup with a download link appears.
* Works cross-platform as long as Python and dependencies are installed.
* You can change the assets and sounds to customize your version of the game.
